<p>
	When you start Casual Quest, or log into a server, you will be taken to the Title Screen. To chat with other users on this server, press the F3 key. To start a game, press the space bar. If there is already a game being played on this server, you will be added as a spectator. When the current wave of monsters is defeated, you will then be added to the game as a player at the start of the next wave.

<p>
	If you would like to skip ahead to more powerful enemies, hold the Shift key when you start a game.

	Use the Arrow keys to move your character and the space bar to attack. Most characters have other special attacks which can be used with the Z, X, and C keys. All characters can call for help using the V key. You can access the Menu by pressing F4, or open and close the chat window by pressing F3. Sometimes a Card Question will appear at the end of a wave; to answer these questions, simply click on of the buttons on the card, or press the 1 key for the first option or the 2 key for the second option.

<p>
	At the end of some waves a Card Question will appear. Answering this question may change your Character Class. Each Character Class has a different icon and different strengths and weaknesses. Knights, for instance, have high strength and a shield which can block projectiles, but they are slow moving and have no magic. The key to advancing through tough waves is to have a diverse party - and don't forget healer!
	</p>
<p>
	Character Classes also have various abilities, which can be used with the Z, X, and C keys.
<p>
	There are four class levels: Knight, Priest, Mage, and Rogue. When you start the game, these levels are all at zero. Answering card questions will raise some levels, and lower others. Each class has a specific class level arrangment. For instance, the Bard is a level 1 Rogue plus a level 1 Priest. Cards are chosen randomly, so at first your Character Class will be subject to random chance, forcing all players to learn how to play all classes well and for the benefit of the team. Eventually you will learn how to push your character towards classes that you prefer.
